**repeat**

I don't really use GitHub much. I'm proficient in/still learning:
* Linux "sysadmin" (specifically NixOS)
* Boxy, comfortable frontend development (HTML, CSS, JS)
* Backend of varying speed (Python, Node.js, attempting Rust)

Talk to me:
* suspecting[at]pm[dot]me
* I'm setting up Tox soon
